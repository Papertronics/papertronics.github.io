  bio: PhD student at IRIDIA (Belgium) in artificial intelligence, Roman works in parallel as a technological artist. Highly interested in the writing of code as a creative process, he enjoys everyday the liberty that emerges when a programming language is seen as any other language. After working on gesture and its visualisation, he now explores new kinds of interaction. Always eager to work on new projects, don't hesitate to send a message!
