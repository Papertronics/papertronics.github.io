    <h3>Us</h3>
        JÃ©remie Cortial and Roman Miletitch are the left and right arms of Papertronics, aiming to find more natural and physical (who said carnal?) ways to interact with new technologies. Pigments on canvas was used by cavemen, so it felt good enough for us. Felt pen, paint or coloured dot stickers on papers, coloured food syrup on thin white waffle, graff on a wall, body paint on bodies... draw by any means necessary, and grant your drawing life by pressing the magical SCAN button. What was static becomes dynamic, alive. A whole new world of messy interactions opens up. We're the welcoming committee.
